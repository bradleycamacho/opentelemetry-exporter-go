# New Relic Go OpenTelemetry exporter [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic)

The `"github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic"` package
provides an exporter for sending OpenTelemetry data to New Relic.  Currently,
traces and the latest metric instruments (as of v0.12 of Open Telemetry) are
supported.


## Installation and Getting Started

Example use:

```go
import "github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic"

func main() {
	// Assumes the NEW_RELIC_API_KEY environment variable contains your New
	// Relic Insights insert API key. This will error if it does not.
	controller, err := newrelic.InstallNewPipeline("My Service")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer controller.Stop()

	/*...*/
}
```

This exporter is built with the alpha release of OpenTelemetry Go client. Due
to the rapid development of OpenTelemetry, this exporter does not guarantee
compatibility with future releases of the OpenTelemetry APIs. Additionally,
this exporter may introduce changes that are not backwards compatible without a
major version increment. We will strive to ensure backwards compatibility when
a stable version of the OpenTelemetry Go client is released.
